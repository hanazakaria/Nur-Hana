            <text style="background-color: bisque;">One of the most popular cat breeds in the world, the British shorthair is appropriately named. Not only do they have a thick, plush short coat, they also have a friendly. British shorthairs make ideal family cats and enjoy being with their owners, but may turn up their noses at being held or cuddled too much.
            This beautiful breed comes in a wide variety of colors and patterns, but the traditional British shorthair is wrapped in blue fur.

            <h4 style="text-align: justify;">
            <p>
               <text style="background-color: bisque;">British shorthairs are beloved for their thick, dense coats that come in almost any color or pattern. Blue-gray cats, often called British blues, are probably the most popular color choice of British shorthair fanciers.
               This breed is also easy to recognize because of their thick legs, broad chests, rounded heads, and chubby cheeks that are totally pinchable. British shorthairs with blue coats have bold orange-amber eyes, but individuals with other coat colors can have green, copper, amber, or blue eyes.

            <text style="background-color: pink;">The most noticeable feature of a Scottish Fold cat is its ears, which are small and tightly folded forward to cover the ear opening. The tips of the ears are rounded. The Scottish Fold is of medium size with a solid compact body. The head is rounded, with well-defined whisker pads, and is set on a short neck. The eyes are large and wide open with a sweet expression. The coat of the Scottish Fold is short and dense. It comes in a variety of colours and patterns.
            
            <p>
            <text style="background-color: pink;">Named after its forward folding ears, the Scottish Fold cat breed was first seen as a natural mutation in Scotland in the 1960s. British cat show judges and numerous veterinary surgeons decided that the cat's folded ears were an undesirable deformity and would make it impossible for the cat to clean its ears. Deformities of the spine, hind legs and tail also appeared when folded-ear cats were bred to one another.</p>

                <text style="background-color: lightcoral;">Long and lithe, words like elegant and graceful were invented for the Siamese cat. This is a striking breed, recognisable as the Siamese cat even by those who know nothing about cats or even dislike cats. They are affectionate and social and can easily adapt to family life but can also be very curious and energetic so be prepared to keep them entertained with games of fetch or long walks around the neighbourhood.

                    <p>
                       <text style="background-color: lightcoral">Incredibly intelligent, affectionate and opinionated, they are considered the extroverts of the feline world. Inclined to bond strongly to one person, and often very vocal with a loud, low-pitched voice (known as a 'meezer'), the Siamese is very much a 'Marmite' type of cat, appealing to a very specific sort of person!
                        Due to their rather dependent nature and attachment to their person, Siamese often suffer from separation anxiety and may be better in pairs, or better still, in homes where someone is around most of the time.

                            This breed is typically easy to care for and incredibly social. They make great family pets and get along well with children. If you have the time and attention to give this fluffy kitty, she will reward you with endless loyalty and love.

Ragdolls are a low-shedding breed, but you may notice heavier seasonal shedding in the spring. The lack of an undercoat is to thank for this breed's lack of shedding, but they are not considered to be a "hypoallergenic" cat.
